            <h2 class="heading">from philosophy</h2>
            <p>During my undergraduate education, I had the opportunity to develop a solid foundation of research and critical thinking skills while working towards my <span class="bold">bachelor’s in political science and philosophy</span>. These skills were bolstered by my professional experience as a researcher that I acquired during and after my undergraduate studies.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">to art</h2>
            <p>I was fortunate to be exposed to the arts from an early age, and after acquiring my diploma, I found myself longing to work with my hands again. I interned at two art studios while working as an assistant for a professional artist. Eventually, I received the opportunity to <span class="bold">travel to China for a master’s of fine arts</span> on a full scholarship from the Chinese government. There, I was able to further develop my aesthetic and conceptual sensibilities while immersing myself in the local culture.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">to design</h2>
            <p>During my master’s, my interests began to gravitate towards design. Design, as a concept, seemed like the perfect mix of my interests and skills. I understand design to be a combination of research, critical thinking, and aesthetics, with the added challenge of empathy. I believe that good design requires empathizing with others to solve problems, fulfill needs, and hopefully improve lives. It’s a challenge I find both exhilarating and fulfilling. I’m currently <span class="bold">pursuing a master’s in industrial design.</span></p>
