                <p>During my undergraduate education, I had the opportunity to develop a solid foundation of research and critical thinking skills while working towards my <span class="bold">bachelor’s in political science and philosophy from Boston University</span>. These skills were bolstered by my professional experience as a researcher that I acquired during and after my undergraduate&nbsp;studies.</p>

                <p>After obtaining my diploma, I interned at two art studios while working as an assistant for a professional artist. Eventually, I received the opportunity to travel to China for a <span class="bold">master’s of fine arts on a full scholarship from the China Academy of Art.</span> There, I was able to further develop my aesthetic and conceptual sensibilities while immersing myself in the local culture. The work from my time in China can be viewed at <a class="link" target="_blank"  href="https://hangzhouarchives.xyz/">hangzhouarchives.xyz</a>.</p>

                <p>During my master’s, my interests began to gravitate towards design. I believe that good design requires empathizing with others to solve problems, fulfill needs, and hopefully improve lives. It’s a challenge I find both exhilarating and fulfilling. I’m currently pursuing a <span class="bold">master’s in industrial design at ENSCI - Les Ateliers in Paris,&nbsp;France.</span>
